# Geospatial-Mapping-using-Python

## Open-source API used for data extraction: Overpass
## Python modules used: plotly.graph_objects, osmnx, matplotlib.pyplot, folium, geopandas, networkx, optalgotools, shapely.geometry

**The first part of the code focuses on:** extracting the coordinates of a particular region of *Toronto, Canada* to visualise features around it, in this case, the locations of restaurants near a set of coordinates. 
Further, we extract the coordinates of restaurants surronding a given region, and map it on a plot. The shortest route between two locations is then mapped, and footprint of the building structures is retrieved. 

**The second part of the code focuses on:** carrying out the aforementioned procedure, but for the city of *Dortmund,Germany.*
